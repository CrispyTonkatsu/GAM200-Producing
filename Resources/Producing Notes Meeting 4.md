> This is a really good reference for Production Consulting + just keeping up with networking events in the industry.

>[!Caution] Lines of Code
>There is a 2 week extension to meet the 400 lines of code. Make sure that the team is meeting their 400 lines. This is essential because we don't want to have the team be stressed or playing catch-up with a horrible deadline at the end.

The biggest concern when it comes to the lines of code, make sure that the team members that start to gain velocity remain with it. A lot of them had a slow start, so the production concern is keeping them at the speed they gained to hit the 400 lines.

To any student that is drastically under the lines of code, they will be contacted and people have to make sure that things are ok with their tasks, additionally, make sure they also have the support for things that they need such as help resubmitting the CLOC program.

To help the team, there are a lot of things one can do. At the middle of the course, there is a big check that will remove all members below the 700 LOC requirement. This is normally a risk that affects the entire production. IF a team-mate is removed, they are completely BANNED from working on the project. If the team becomes too small, they will merge teams to make sure teams are viable. The minimum team size is 3 people.

Things one can do:
- Cheer them on.
- Guarantee that they have the things they need to work.
- Encourage them asking for help.
- Switching tasks around. (To re-organise the code count gained) (Big code gains: Serialisation, Dear imGUI, particles, UI frameworks, etc.)

## Midterms
Midterms means we have no mandatory meetings in weeks 6, 7, and 8.
The rubric is slightly going to be changed so save a backup of the rubric before it gets changed.
Weeks 9 and 10 will have a list of missing requirements made in a meeting w the professors.

At the end of the semester, there is time for a brief demo of the game. This will be shown to designers?? hopefully?? but it is entirely optional so we should opt to do it just to see other team's work at that point in the semester.


>[!caution] Edgar's reminder
>Make a backlog you doofus. We need to know what is left in the game.
>Additionally, make sure that your team is taking care of themselves, that it is doing ok, that they are in good terms w the rest of the team. Things you can do:
>- Sprint Review: Just do a little review of all the cool progress we have made while writing down what is completely done and what isn't.
>- Sprint Retrospective: Review *how* things were done during this sprint. The second part is, celebrate all the completed work. Celebrating is the most important part, this is a super complex path to get there, so not celebrating is a waste of morale.
