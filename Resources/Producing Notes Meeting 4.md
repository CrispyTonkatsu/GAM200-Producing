>[!Caution] Lines of Code
>There is a 2 week extension to meet the 400 lines of code. Make sure that the team is meeting their 400 lines. This is essential because we don't want to have the team be stressed or playing catch-up with a horrible deadline at the end.

The biggest concern when it comes to the lines of code, make sure that the team members that start to gain velocity remain with it. A lot of them had a slow start, so the production concern is keeping them at the speed they gained to hit the 400 lines.

To any student that is drastically under the lines of code, they will be contacted and people have to make sure that things are ok with their tasks, additionally, make sure they also have the support for things that they need such as help resubmitting the CLOC program.
