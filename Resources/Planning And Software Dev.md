## Normally stuff will not go to plan.

When making a scope, do not account for trivial situations. This is important because you want to actually achieve something. Hence, make sure that there is planning to make sure there are no big turns taken which might limit the project's potential. However, make sure to give proper room to innovation compared to the original idea. 

Work velocity will never be constant, the important part of this is knowing how to manage expectations to be able to power through the hard bits knowing there will be highs coming.

In our case, the biggest possible concern is the fact that we are trying to make a super stable engine. This means that we need to start accounting for the lack of speed whilst making sure that we aren't sacrificing our goals. Aka, we need to pour focus into having a square moving on the screen.

The typical A priorities:
- Graphics on screen (Almost done)
- Basic Input (Done)
- Basic Physics + Collision (Getting there)
- JSON serialization (Done)
- Documentation
- Creating an installer
- Playtesting
- TCR testing and verification (????)
- Code Reviews (We do it already)

## Estimation
Make sure to use T-Shirt sizes to estimate the time a task will take. This is good to know when to ask for help, who would do it and if anyone has any concerns which no one knows about before even tackling the task.
