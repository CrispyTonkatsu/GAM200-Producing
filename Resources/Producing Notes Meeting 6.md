Prepare all the rubric stuff that we might need.
Ask about whether the way we have our Obsidian keep track of the documentation can work for our little technical guide.

By the end of the pregrading meeting, we are going to have a really nice set of things that are just missing. This is a binding rubric. This means that even if something breaks, it will still be considered complete and you will be expected to complete it next semester.

Focus on passing the class instead of refactoring everything. We get a whole milestone next semester to handle that.

The team pregrading should have as many teammates as possible.
