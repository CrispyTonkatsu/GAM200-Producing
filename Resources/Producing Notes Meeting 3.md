Consider signing up the team for a meeting after the milestone 1 and all the problems to tackle become easier to identify within the team. 
This can be a fun 'celebration' as well as a moment to reflect on the first milestone and what can be improved.

For M1 we need 4 things: (Lasts 10 minutes)
- The team to show up (if they can)
- Current build
- Laptops with the engine and build working on release *not in development environment* (A little video just in case)
- Filled slide deck (each member fills their part) and a physical copy
- Have a copy of the *checklist* which shows what we have and what we don't. (The goal is to have a 70% passing for the team atm).

The presentation's order is:
- Intro of team
- DEMO
- Slide deck
- Checklist with what we have that is required and what are kudos
- Prepare for the short 10 minutes we will have

Friday hour 1 will be a small team training session for the "External Markers" reflects our team and code structure. We have to highlight the order we have in the team. A team with appeal, exudes confidence and success.

Make the team seem put together and aware of the 8 minutes we will have.

Last presentation of the semester *might* have designers. We NEED to be good at presenting by then. Right now is the perfect time to shoot all of our blanks and see what works.
