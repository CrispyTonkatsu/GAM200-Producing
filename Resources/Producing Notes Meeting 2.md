## Scheduling
Schedules are an essential part of managing the only resource we have in the class (time). Therefore, allocating it properly can lead to bigger issues such as:
- Not meeting minimum viable product (Check the rubric and evaluate the requirements)
- "You're not the only one who has to do the producing work, just make sure its getting done" - Ellen Beeman
Backlogs are essential as they provide the roadwork for the rest of the time unless there are big changes. Making a concise and assigned backlog allows the team to know what is their domain and what they can do within their time. This is means: make sure the shirt fits the person and the magnitude of the task.  

An efficient mechanism to find the size of the shirt is to talk with the rest of the team and see what sizes they are assigning. The way this works is by comparing the different opinions and being able to catch unexpected problems from things such as:
- Overestimating time for a task (1 week for AABB collision)
- Underestimating time for a task (1 week for space partitioning)

### More on scheduling
Engine Proof (week 5)

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This process involves evaluating the current needs for the minimum viable product and allocating the size for the tasks as well as evaluating whether this is a need for the MVP.  

The next step is the Critical Path, this refers to what tasks rely on other tasks and how to deal with them. Recognizing them allows the team to know what to actually start on and how many people are needed. 

Once the diagram is known, make sure to record it as thoroughly as possible. Making sure that this data will be valuable to actually plan further with more knowledge on the rubric. Once you are done with the breakdown, make sure to get rid of the separate elements and do 2020 vision. Then start to randomly select them and organise where in the timeline the task should go. This is essential to see all the disagreements in order to guarantee all that is being done will actually advance the production. Additionally, discussing the tasks will make more questions arise. 

The goal of these processes is to guarantee the team has thoroughly evaluate all the priorities of the team and how the team can do them. Make sure to encourage people to voice their opinions as this is *essential* for this to work. 

### Stand-ups
Stand-ups are a process in which two members of the team stand up and say what I am working on/finished, what am I doing next, what is stopping me from doing something next.

This is normally a procedure to prevent wasted work. Cause why would you do stuff that won't make it in...... 

It also helps to prevent time sinks to happen as people think more about the next steps before doing them. Letting the team interject and catch possible wasted resources.

This is super explosive if not handled well, it can lead to team conflicts as people are either hoarding time or damaging the bonds between the team. To avoid this, the producer must plan in advance to arrange the stand-up order and encourage people to be honest and receptive. Take time wasting to the "parking lot"(to talk about it).
