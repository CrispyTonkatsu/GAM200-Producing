Their goal this week is to make a mesh class and get basic sprite animation in the game. 

To do this they are going to follow these steps:
- Create a mesh class (April here on Wednesday)
- Create factory functions for primitives
- Check it textures can be imported into the game (IResource reliant)
- Make a sprite animator node (Node + SceneTree reliant)

If you can't do the latter steps because the rest of the team is still working:
- Speedylog/whatever for logging (as a Server)
