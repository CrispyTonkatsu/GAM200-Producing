Get the physics server to process AABB collisions.

This means that they should focus on the following steps:
- Creating the physics server
- Creating the data structures for the AABB
- Implementing the narrow-phase collision detection for all boxes in the server
- Use the factory methods for meshes April is doing to show the collision in action

If [[April Rathamone]] is struggling with the primitives, they should help them achieve their goal together.
