The core is composed of all the abstract and base classes for the entire engine. This is split into:
- Object
- Variant
- Reference
- Main Loop

These are elements which will be done by [[Kishan Patel]] in order to implement reflection and Lua scripting into the engine.

Object is the base class that will implement most methods needed to marshal the data and use signals.

>[!info] Just get the aesthetic for now
>Don't worry too much about getting it 100%, you can ask questions about it when it's done. The implementation is still in the works so details are still in the air.
